# Hammertime Panel

Extended moderation for your vanilla server

Currently allows for : 

	- Caps protection
	- Player movement warning broadcasting to server operators
	- - Kick for flying, optional moved wrongly
	- Simple callvote for permitted players
	- Word filter - both whole word and part of word detection
	- - Fully configurable
	- IP tracking - notification when IPs of 2 players match
	- - IP blacklist for persistent people
	- - - Warning only by default, supports bash scripting for people who want to be special

This is still a work in progress.
